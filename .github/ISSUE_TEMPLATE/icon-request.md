<!--
Before creating a new issue ensure that:

1. The icon is not already present (open https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/find/master and start typing the icon name to make sure)
2. The icon request is not a duplicate
3. The app is not installed by snap (the snap packages have hardcoded paths to icons)
4. The app is not a Windows application running under Wine/Crossover
5. The title contains application or icon name (Ex: [Icon request] Boostnote)

NOTE:
You'll find most of necessary entries for the icon request in a app's desktop-file, usually placed in /usr/share/applications/ folder (Ex. /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop).
